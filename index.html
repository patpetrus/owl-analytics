                <p>With the release of Overwatch Two slated for 2022, fans are more excited than ever to see the new changes Blizzard has in store for the game.
                    One change, however, has been met with trepedation: the change from a 6v6 two-tank roster to a 5v5 single-tank roster.
                    For those lone tank players, the game pressures are likely to double. 
                    The role of a tank in Overwatch is, essentially, to take space, take damage, and provide necessary shielding for lower-HP characters to make plays.
                    Which current Overwatch League tanks tank the hardest? Let's find out!

            <p>Let's definte "tankiness" in this context as a player's ability to block and take damage. 
                Tank characters are generally larger in size, have larger health pools than the dps/support roster, and (mostly) come equipped with some kind of shield. 
                Using this kit, they have the opportunity to absorb damage via said shields ("damage blocked") as well as absorb it with their higher health pools ("damage taken").
                For individuals, we will also include their damage output ("damage done"), as an additional metric of on-field effectiveness. </p>
                
            <p>Taking a look at the top five tanks' stats across the four different map types, it's interesting to note that each player has one map type that they generally perform better in. 
                Super seems to prefer payload and hybrid maps (which are very similar in how they play), Shredlock performs better on assault maps, Gater prefers hybrid maps, etc. </p>
                
            <p>This could be chocked up in part to the ammount of playtime a player recieves between each different type of map, though this may be somewhat of a self-fulfilling prophesy, as coaches who notice a player performing well on one specific type of map are likely to play that player on that type of map more often. </p>
                
            <p>With OW2 moving to a single-tank model, the tanks who remain will have to compensate for their weaknesses or risk losing their spots on the roster.
                This means more time working on map types that play against their strengths, and less time honing their strengths to razor-sharp edges. </p>

            <p>Tl,dr: only one tank role per team means less room for specialization. </p>
            
            <p>With tens of millions of dollars in prize pools and even more in endoresment deals, teams will be scramling to find the best combination of generalized play and specialization to create a winning strategy. 
                Will this spell an end to dramatic one-trick performances from OWL's most sensational tanks? We'll have to wait and see.</p>
